2002-05-22

	* Makefile.in:  Added test target so 'make test' works.
	Modified install to go to correct pkg directory with
	pre-fabricated pkgIndex.tcl.  Corrected binary library 
	install so that executable bits are set.

	* units.c:
	Bug 528313:  Corrected incompatible units check.
	Bug 528316:  Corrected null exception pointer problem.

	* units.i:  Corrected convertTypedWrapperValue which was 
	returning a local variable.

	* units.n:  Added this file, generated from units.xml

	* units.xml:  De-tabified tables so they look better in 
	man format.

	* units.test: 
	Added tests to illustrate behavior reported in bug 528687.
	Converting a null value returns 1.0, which is consistent 
	with the default value assinged to unit strings without a 
	scale factor.  Added tests 6.2 and 6.3 to catch extra units 
	conversion errors.

	* units_wrap.c:  Regenerated from units.i.
