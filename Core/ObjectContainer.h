	/// Object container to help handle memory management issues
	/**
	This class acts as a pointer to an object with a little more functionality.
	It is automatically initialised to NULL and whenever the object needs to be
	copied it creates a copy of the object it contains. The difference with a
	normal pointer is that a normal pointer will not create a copy of the object
	it points to. It simply creates a copy of the address, which can lead to
	problems when the object is deleted. The copied pointers will no longer be
	valid. This problem is avoided by creating a copy of the object it contains.
	For this to work the object	must have a function called "Copy" that creates
	a copy of itself and returns a pointer to the new copy.

	Note: This is NOT a reference counting system.
